- I found and perused this repo on git: https://github.com/icarrera/bus-mall to help me understand more about how to implement my event listeners, and a little of the charts.js to see what refactoring I needed to implement it. While I did type out some of the code, verbatim, I made sure I understood what the code was doing, and adjusted variable names to fit my existing code.

- I used @awallraff Adam Wallraff's helper code, from slack, for getting started on my displayImages function.  I had to make a lot of adjustments to make it work, but it was helpful after I walked through the code line-by-line to understand how it worked.

- TA @rburke RachelBurke reviewed my User Stories [user_stories.md]("busmall-start/user_stories.md") and gave me buy-off on hittimg MVP + if I implemented all of them.
