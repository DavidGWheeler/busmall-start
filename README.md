- I found and perused this repo on git: https://github.com/icarrera/bus-mall to help me understand more about how to implement my event listeners, and a little of the charts.js to see what refactoring I needed to implement it. ~~While I did type out some of the code, verbatim, I made sure I understood what the code was doing, and adjusted variable names to fit my existing code.~~ I ended up not using any of the code I had typed out, from icarrera's repo, after all and used cahrts.js documentation to figure this out. it was still a valuable exercise in reading another person's code for compareson.

- I used @awallraff Adam Wallraff's helper code, from slack, for getting started on my displayImages function.  I had to make a lot of adjustments to make it work, but it was helpful after I walked through the code line-by-line to understand how it worked.

- TA @rburke RachelBurke reviewed my User Stories [user_stories.md]("busmall-start/user_stories.md") and gave me buy-off on hittimg MVP + if I implemented all of them.

- Student @arczero1 Brandon Little contributed his knowledge of the .includes method on an array, for evaluating repeated images in my array of previouslyShown.

- Student @luis_manzo Luis Manzo contributed his knowledge of the forEach methond on arrays and offered a tutorial link: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-the-array-foreach-method

- Student @robert_hatfield Robert Hatfield helped me with getting some of my key values to create a list.
